# Databases

I am currently in the process of migrating away from Planetscale due to their decision to discontinue their hobby plan ([link](https://planetscale.com/docs/concepts/hobby-plan-deprecation-faq#how-do-i-migrate-off-of-planetscale-)). This means that I will no longer be able to use their services for my database needs.

As a result, I will be transitioning my databases to SQLite and save the sqlite files in this repository. This will make it easy to develop and work locally, also using different machines by cloning the repos and database files accordingly.
